"""Refill stage: replace the cards that verify and dedup dropped.

A request asks for N cards, and each one the checker rejects or dedup
recognises leaves the day that much short. This stage asks again for exactly
the missing number, showing the model what was rejected and why, then puts the
new cards through the same verify and dedup as the rest of the day.

One round only. A topic that keeps failing should not spend the free tier's
daily requests on it, and a second round would mostly repeat the first.

Idempotent like every stage: its cards are flagged `refill`, and a rerun
removes them, with their verify and dedup rows, before asking again.
