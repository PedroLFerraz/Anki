"""Dedup stage: drop generated cards that repeat something already studied.

Two tiers, ported from v1:
  1. fuzzy — near-identical question wording (cheap, always on)
  2. semantic — embedding similarity, catches rephrasings

A card is compared against its deck's existing notes, cards kept by earlier
runs that haven't been imported into Anki yet, and cards already kept earlier
in this same run.

Embeddings are cached in the warehouse by content hash, so after the first run
only new or edited notes are embedded. Only decks the profile targets are ever
embedded — a 5,000-card language deck that isn't being generated for costs nothing.
